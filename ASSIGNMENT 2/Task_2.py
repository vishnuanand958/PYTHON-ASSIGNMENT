    Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
        Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
        1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
        2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
        3.   Displays the final sum.
        
    Expected Output:
        The program should return:
         
        The sum of number from 1 to 50 is: 1275

sum =0
for i in range(1,51):
    sum +=i

print("The sum of number from 1 to 50 is :",sum)
